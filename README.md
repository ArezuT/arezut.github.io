# **History of Sugar**
## **Where Sugar Originated**
[Sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_sugar) was produced in India through the production of sugarcane plants during the 1st century AD. Moreover, the cultivation and manufacturing of sugar was in the Bengal Regions. 
However, the actual cultivation of sugarcane began by one the Papuan in New Gineua and another in Taiwan where it was later introduced to India.
## **How it Spread**
From the Island of southeast asia where one end reached China and the other reached from India through Persia and slowly making its ways to the Arab Nations and throughout europe. Sugar became the most expensive spice of it's time.
## **Manufacturer of Refined Sugar**
Ever since sugar was introduced to the Americas in the 16th century, particularly in the West Indies and tropical regions, the production of sugar in that region saw significant advancements in the 17th and 18th centuries. The 19th and 20th centuries saw the creation of beet sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, and other sweeteners.

## **Early use of sugarcane in India**
Sugarcane originated in tropical Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.Different species likely originated in different locations with <em>S. barberi</em> originating in India and <em>S. edule</em> and <em>S. officinarum</em> coming from New Guinea. Originally, people chewed sugarcane raw to extract its sweetness. Indians discovered how to crystallize sugar during the Gupta dynasty, c. 350 AD although literary evidence from Indian treatises such as Arthashastra in the 2nd century AD indicates that refined sugar was already being produced in India.

Indian sailors, consumers of clarified butter and sugar, carried sugar by various trade routes.Travelling Buddhist monks brought sugar crystallization methods to China. During the reign of Harsha (r. 606–647) in North India, Indian envoys in Tang China taught sugarcane cultivation methods after Emperor Taizong of Tang (r. 626–649) made his interest in sugar known, and China soon established its first sugarcane cultivation in the seventh century. Chinese documents confirm at least two missions to India, initiated in 647 AD, for obtaining technology for sugar-refining. In India, the Iran and China, sugar became a staple of cooking and desserts.

Early refining methods involved grinding or pounding the cane in order to extract the juice, and then boiling down the juice or drying it in the sun to yield sugary solids that looked like gravel. The Sanskrit word for <b>"sugar"</b> (sharkara) also means <b>"gravel"</b> or <b>"sand"</b>. In Persian: shakar (Traditional Persian: <i>شکر</i> ) (the root of the world word sugar from Persian shakar, which is from Sanskrit <i>śarkarā</i>) means sweetening seeds in Farsi. Similarly, the Chinese use the term "gravel sugar" (Traditional Chinese: <i>砂糖</i>) for what is known in the west as "table sugar".

In 1792, sugar prices soared in Great Britain. On 15 March 1792, his Majesty's Ministers to the British parliament presented a report related to the production of refined sugar in British India. Lieutenant J. Paterson, of the Bengal Presidency, reported that refined sugar could be produced in India with many superior advantages, and a lot more cheaply than in the West Indies.
